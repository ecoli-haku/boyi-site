Hi! I'm Boyi Wang (王博艺), a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) (MPI-PKS) in Dresden, Germany. I do theoretical physics to satisfy my curiosity about the question "Life is what?" — and if lucky, even "What is life?"

More concretely, I play with statistical physics models, like the lovely [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), to explore [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality) (and other [symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_breaking) rules) in self-organized or phase-separated systems — especially the interfaces. I also develop theories to understand biological interfaces in embryonic development, from mammalian skull-growth front to fetal–maternal crosstalk at the placenta.

I received my Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics in January 2025, after a B.Sc. in Biology in June 2018.
To know more about me, feel free to check out my [CV page]({{< ref "/cv.md" >}}).
